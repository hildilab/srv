    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <p><a name="q01" class="intralink" ><h3>1. What should I do when I see a security prompt from Java?</h3></a> Java Update 21 introduces changes to the browser plugin security level. Opening Provi you'll receive a security warning from Java asking whether to block the use of the applet (choose: No).</p>


    <p><a name="q02" class="intralink"><h3>2. Using keyword search resulted in no obvious results? </h3></a> The keyword search is a full-text search based on the PDB entries KEYWDS, searching for "G-protein" will get you "<u>G-protein</u> coupled receptors,but also family A" AND "Bindin<u>g-protein</u>-dependent transport system". The keyword search is therefore not optimal for a family search. But its useful if you are looking for e.g. "transporter".</p>


    <p><a name="q03" class="intralink"><h3>3. Which browsers are recommended for MPPD usage?</h3></a> We have tested the site with Google Chrome 5.x+, Mozilla Firefox 3.x+, and Microsoft Internet Explorer 8. Our Visualisation Tool Provi works best with more recent and faster browser versions, e.g. the current version of <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>.</p>


    <p><a name="q04" class="intralink"><h3>4. There are problems showing the results in the built-in molecular viewer Provi.</h3></a> Java must be installed in order to make Provi available. Make sure you are running an updated version of Java.<br><br>

    * To test whether Java Applets in general are working on your computer, please consult <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/testjava.jsp" target="_blank">this page</a> and if necessary follow the suggestions there.<br><br>

    * The 3D protein viewer component in Provi relies entirely on Jmol which requires a working Java installation. To test whether your combination operating system, web browser and Java supports Jmol, please visit <a href="http://jmol.sourceforge.net/browsercheck/" target="_blank">this page</a>.<br><br>

    * If your problem persists, please do not hesitate to contact us via <a href="mailto:alexander.rose@charite.de">email</a>.<br><br></p>


    <p><a name="q05" class="intralink"><h3>5. I can't find my protein in MPPD?</h3></a> MPPD contains only polytopic, transmembrane spanning proteins. If you want a specific PDB file calculated, please <a href="mailto:alexander.rose@charite.de">contact us</a>.</p>


    <p><a name="q06" class="intralink"><h3>6. Provi is slow, can I speed it up?</h3></a> As with all graphical applications the performance heavily depends on the screen resolution. Reducing the size of the browser window down should result in a speed up.</p>
